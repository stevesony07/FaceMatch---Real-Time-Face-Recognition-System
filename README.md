# FaceMatch---Real-Time-Face-Recognition-System
FaceMatch is a real-time face recognition system that captures images of individuals, saves them into a dataset, and recognizes faces using DeepFace in real-time. The project is divided into two main scripts: one for capturing and saving images, and another for performing real-time face recognition.
